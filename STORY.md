## 2023

### JavaScript and Discord.JS

My programming story begins in 2023. My friend [rolyPolyVole](https://rolyPolyVole.github.io) had been experimenting with Discord bots and the Discord.JS API. 

He created his own custom-made Discord bot called the Void Bot, that had many features. It had custom responses, could send embeds, and much more. It was specially made for his development server and integrated itself into the server very well.

This inspired me to learn JavaScript on [freeCodeCamp](https://freeCodeCamp.org). I completed the course in its entirety during my free time while on vacation. I was very proud to have completed the course.

After that, I tried to follow a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgOXmQMT68) by famous YouTuber [Fusion Terror](https://www.youtube.com/@FusionTerror/videos) which explained in detail how to set up a professional and easily expandable codebase for a Discord bot.

At first, I struggled. I found it difficult to understand concepts such as exports and arrow functions, but eventually I got the hang of it and I learned how to create my own commands, buttons, and menus after watching the course to the end. The tutorial series also taught me how to use MongoDB to store user data.

I decided to create my own bot called **Slime Bot**. This bot grew extensively and at the end of its development had >20 commands and features including a quadratic equation solver, an 8ball, and even an embed builder that saved users' embeds to a MongoDB database.

I learned TypeScript at the end of 2023 and migrated the bot over.
